# LIDAR-Turret-Platform
A 2-person project where a LIDAR sensor is spun around to detect objects in a 360Â° sweep and display objects on a screen. Unfortunately, due to difficulties experienced in implementation, not all functions of the project were completed in time. This repo contains code I developed to take measured position/object data, and update a screen accordingly.
